  abstract    = "As tumors grow, they acquire mutations, some of which create
                 neoantigens that influence the response of patients to immune
                 checkpoint inhibitors. We explored the impact of neoantigen
                 intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) on antitumor immunity. Through
                 integrated analysis of ITH and neoantigen burden, we
                 demonstrate a relationship between clonal neoantigen burden
                 and overall survival in primary lung adenocarcinomas.
                 CD8(+)tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes reactive to clonal
                 neoantigens were identified in early-stage non-small cell lung
                 cancer and expressed high levels of PD-1. Sensitivity to PD-1
                 and CTLA-4 blockade in patients with advanced NSCLC and
                 melanoma was enhanced in tumors enriched for clonal
                 neoantigens. T cells recognizing clonal neoantigens were
                 detectable in patients with durable clinical benefit.
                 Cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced subclonal neoantigens,
                 contributing to an increased mutational load, were enriched in
                 certain poor responders. These data suggest that neoantigen
                 heterogeneity may influence immune surveillance and support
                 therapeutic developments targeting clonal neoantigens.",

  abstract    = "Little is known about how RNA editing operates in cancer.
                 Transcriptome analysis of 68 normal and cancerous breast
                 tissues revealed that the editing enzyme ADAR acts uniformly,
                 on the same loci, across tissues. In controlled ADAR
                 expression experiments, the editing frequency increased at all
                 loci with ADAR expression levels according to the logistic
                 model. Loci-specific ``editabilities,'' i.e., propensities to
                 be edited by ADAR, were quantifiable by fitting the logistic
                 function to dose-response data. The editing frequency was
                 increased in tumor cells in comparison to normal controls.
                 Type I interferon response and ADAR DNA copy number together
                 explained 53\% of ADAR expression variance in breast cancers.
                 ADAR silencing using small hairpin RNA lentivirus transduction
                 in breast cancer cell lines led to less cell proliferation and
                 more apoptosis. A-to-I editing is a pervasive, yet
                 reproducible, source of variation that is globally controlled
                 by 1q amplification and inflammation, both of which are highly
                 prevalent among human cancers.",

                 tumorigenesis and have been the focus of much attention in
                 recent years. However, genetic content also may change farther
                 downstream. RNA editing alters the mRNA sequence from its
                 genomic blueprint in a dynamic and flexible way. A few
                 isolated cases of editing alterations in cancer have been
                 reported previously. Here, we provide a transcriptome-wide
                 characterization of RNA editing across hundreds of cancer
                 samples from multiple cancer tissues, and we show that A-to-I
                 editing and the enzymes mediating this modification are
                 significantly altered, usually elevated, in most cancer types.
                 Increased editing activity is found to be associated with

  abstract = "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a clinically aggressive
              subtype of breast cancer commonly resistant to therapeutics that
              have been successful in increasing survival in ER+ and HER2+
              breast cancer patients. As such, identifying factors that
              contribute to poor patient outcomes and mediate the growth and
              survival of TNBC cells remain important areas of investigation.
              MTBP (MDM2 Binding Protein), a gene linked to cellular
              proliferation and a transcriptional target of the MYC oncogene,
              is over-expressed in human malignancies, yet its contribution to
              cancer remains unresolved. Evaluation of mRNA expression and copy
              number variation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
              revealed MTBP is commonly overexpressed in breast cancer and 19\%
              show amplification of MTBP. Increased transcript or gene
              amplification of MTBP significantly correlated with reduced
              breast cancer patient survival. Further analysis revealed that
              while MTBP mRNA is over-expressed in both ER+ and HER2+ breast
              cancers, its expression is highest in TNBC. MTBP mRNA and protein
              levels were also significantly elevated in a panel of human TNBC
              cell lines. Knockdown of MTBP in TNBC model systems induced
              apoptosis and significantly reduced TNBC cell growth and soft
              agar colony formation, which was rescued by expression of
              shRNA-resistant Mtbp. Notably, inducible knockdown of MTBP
              expression significantly impaired TNBC tumor growth, in vivo,
              including in established tumors. Thus, these data emphasize MTBP
              is important for the growth and survival of TNBC and warrants
              further investigation as a potential novel therapeutic target.
              Implications: MTBP significantly contributes to breast cancer
              survival and is a potential novel therapeutic target in TNBC.",

                 types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney

              and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific
              mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype.
              We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups,
              possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and
              integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways
              dominant in each molecular subtype including a
              HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature
              within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of
              basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours
              showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related
              aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological
              finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by
              different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises
              the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity
              and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major
              biological subtypes of breast cancer.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Circos is a Perl language based software package for
              visualizing similarities and differences of genome structure and
              positional relationships between genomic intervals. Running
              Circos requires extra data processing procedures to prepare plot
              data files and configure files from datasets, which limits its
              capability of integrating directly with other software tools such
              as R. Recently published R Bioconductor package ggbio provides a
              function to display genomic data in circular layout based on
              multiple other packages, which increases its complexity of usage
              and decreased the flexibility in integrating with other R
              pipelines. RESULTS: We implemented an R package, RCircos, using
              only R packages that come with R base installation. The package
              supports Circos 2D data track plots such as scatter, line,
              histogram, heatmap, tile, connectors, links, and text labels.
              Each plot is implemented with a specific function and input data
              for all functions are data frames which can be objects read from
              text files or generated with other R pipelines. CONCLUSION:
              RCircos package provides a simple and flexible way to make Circos
              2D track plots with R and could be easily integrated into other R
              data processing and graphic manipulation pipelines for presenting
              large-scale multi-sample genomic research data. It can also serve

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Trellis graphics are a visualization method that
                 splits data by one or more categorical variables and displays
                 subsets of the data in a grid of panels. Trellis graphics are
                 broadly used in genomic data analysis to compare statistics
                 over different categories in parallel and reveal multivariate
                 relationships. However, current software packages to produce
                 Trellis graphics have not been designed with genomic data in
                 mind and lack some functionality that is required for
                 effective visualization of genomic data. RESULTS: Here we
                 introduce the gtrellis package which provides an efficient and
                 extensible way to visualize genomic data in a Trellis layout.
                 gtrellis provides highly flexible Trellis layouts which allow
                 efficient arrangement of genomic categories on the plot. It
                 supports multiple-track visualization, which makes it
                 straightforward to visualize several properties of genomic
                 data in parallel to explain complex relationships. In
                 addition, gtrellis provides an extensible framework that
                 allows adding user-defined graphics. CONCLUSIONS: The gtrellis
                 package provides an easy and effective way to visualize
                 genomic data and reveal high dimensional relationships on a
                 genome-wide scale. gtrellis can be flexibly extended and thus
                 can also serve as a base package for highly specific purposes.

  abstract    = "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network has made
                 public a large collection of clinical and molecular phenotypes
                 of more than 10 000 tumor patients across 33 different tumor
                 types. Using this cohort, TCGA has published over 20 marker
                 papers detailing the genomic and epigenomic alterations
                 associated with these tumor types. Although many important
                 discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network,
                 opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby
                 elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers.
                 However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics
                 challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with
                 clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA
                 methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called
                 TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer
                 bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow
                 users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of
                 TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and
                 statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies
                 developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own
                 group. Using four different TCGA tumor types (Kidney, Brain,
                 Breast and Colon) as examples, we provide case studies to
                 illustrate examples of reproducibility, integrative analysis
                 and utilization of different Bioconductor packages to advance
                 and accelerate novel discoveries.",

                 projects (such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)) for further
                 analysis is an important and time consuming step for research
                 projects. Several efforts, such as the Firehose project, make
                 TCGA pre-processed data publicly available via web services
                 and data portals, but this information must be managed,
                 downloaded and prepared for subsequent steps. We have
                 developed an open source and extensible R based data client
                 for pre-processed data from the Firehouse, and demonstrate its
                 use with sample case studies. Results show that our
                 RTCGAToolbox can facilitate data management for researchers
                 interested in working with TCGA data. The RTCGAToolbox can
                 also be integrated with other analysis pipelines for further
                 data processing. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The
